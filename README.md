![PeopleList](https://github.com/stef-ang/ModernSwapi/assets/6779288/93255102-e207-4179-9cf9-74b749bcbb82) | ![PeopleDetail](https://github.com/stef-ang/ModernSwapi/assets/6779288/6d45c89f-b6e1-49ff-9a71-f1cbd3ca8c3f)

This app only has two screens: List of people screen and detail of people screen. The data source comes from [Swapi Api](https://swapi.dev/documentation).
This project is my playground to explore Modern Android Development practice.

## üìö Stacks

- [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - Performing asynchronous code with sequential manner.
- [Kotlin Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Reactive streams based on coroutines that can emit multiple values sequentially.
- [Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - The DI framework which reduces the boilerplate.
- [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Presenter with its semi data persistence behavior.
- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Android modern toolkit for building native UI.
- [Compose Material 3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/designsystems/material3) - Helping me present Material Design.

- [Compose Paging 3](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/paging) - Helping me manage pagination with ease.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android.

## üìê Architecture and Design Principles

This app adopts [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) with [Unidirectional flow (UDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidirectional_Data_Flow_(computer_science)) pattern. It follows [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) and [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) to achieve maintainable, scalable and testable code base. Also the code base has been structured in multi-module project.
